Project 1

Given 'nand' gate, built the following gates in HDL (hardware description language):

1. Not
2. And
3. Or
4. Xor
5. Mux
6. Dmux
7. Not16
8. And16
9. Or16
10. Mux16
11. Or8Way
12. Mux4Way16
13. Mux8Way16
14. DMux4Way
15. DMux8Way

These are commonly used gates and they comprise all the elementary logic gates
needed to build our computer, the so-called 'hackOS'.
