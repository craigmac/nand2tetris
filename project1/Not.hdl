/*
 * Not.hdl --- 'Not' chip/gate implementation
 * We are given 'NAND' chip as fully implemented
 * to use.
 *
 * Nand truth table:
 * a  b  out
 * 1  0  1
 * 0  0  1
 * 0  1  1
 * 1  1  0
 *
 * Equal to saying "if a !== b return 1 else return 0"
 * Nand can used to replace And, Not, and Or gates:
 *
 * And using Nand:
 * (x And y) == Not(x Nand y)
 *
 * Replacing Not with Nand (we fan x signal into both Nand inputs)
 * Not(x) == (x Nand x)
 *
 * So all together:
 * (x And y) == Not(x Nand y) =>
 *   ((x Nand y) Nand (x Nand y))
 *
 * Or can be replace with And and Not used in
 * conjunction, so then you'd just replace those
 * with Nand gates.
