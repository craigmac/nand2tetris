Project 3:
Given:
 - all previous chips built in project 1 and 2
 - Data Flip-Flop (DFF gate)

Goal: Build the following
 - Bit (done)
 - Register (done)
 - RAM8
 - RAM64
 - RAM512
 - RAM4K
 - RAM16K
 - PC

Hints/Guidelines:

RAM8: if load {
            M = in
            // from next cycle onward
            out = M
            }
      else out = M

Tip:
 * Feed in value to all registers simultaneously
 * Use mux/dmux chips to select right register

RAM64:
    * use RAM8 already built, stack 8 RAM8 chips together, think about address
    input as a binary value that consists of two fields:
        1. One field to select a RAM-part
        2. Other field used to select a register within that RAM-part
    High/low part of byte maybe?
    * use mux/dmux logic to effect this addressing scheme

RAM512:
    * use 8 RAM64 chips

RAM4K, RAM16K:
    * same thing as above

PC:
    * Can be built with Register chip, and incrementor chip and some logic
      gates.
